# About Me 👋

🌌 I'm fascinated by the invisible energy that surround us every day. I think it's truly beautiful that, with the right tools, anyone can send information (visibly) out of thin air. This interest technologically is very much a product of my greater passion of breathwork and studying concepts such as Vāstu and Feng Shui for example. I think it's very important to finding balance in the flow of energy in environments, in a way, code is a reflection of that. 🧘🏽‍♂️

🎨 My other interests include academia, art, music, and hitting the gym ᕙ(•̀‸•́‶)ᕗ
